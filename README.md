# Machine Learning - AI
# Task
 Create a new repo called "machine-learning" and include a read-me file which will give more information about the repo.
Using the data set provided, carry out an exploratory and explanatory analysis using a jupyter notebook
Push this notebook to the repo ("machine-learning")  and include more information on the read-me of the analysis task to give more context on the dataset and the whole analysis.
The link to the repo should be included in the document that will be provided.

# Introduction
This Repo contains all the code and data used to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking demand Data Set CVS.
The Hostel demand data set contains a single file which compares various booking information between two hotels: a city hotel and a resort hotel and it can be gotten on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand 
The aim of this EDA is to explore the dataset, gain insights, and provide a summary of the findings. The analysis is performed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis of theHotel booking demand data set allows us to process, analyse and summerise the main characteristics, patterns, and relationships within the dataset

The steps for EDA in this repository is as follows:
Step 1 : Importing libraries that are important for visualizing and exploring the dataset
Step 2 : Reading or Importing the dataset
Step 3 : Describing the data to understand the general out look of the data
Step 4 : Finding and fixing problems with missing values
Step 5 : Exploring and visualizing the data

In step three the following questions were explored and answered during the EDA;
1.kind of customer are there 
2.what type of rooms are mostly reserved 
3.which hotels are booked more
4.which months has the most book
5.Which country has the most bookings
6.Which agents have the most hotel bookings
7.Which hotel has the most cancelled bookings etc.........
